I noticed that a lot of people have searched for a snipping tool for Linux like the one that is on Windows,
and I didn't see this solution anywhere in the answers.

1. Download the zip of this repository.
2. Unzip it.
3. In terminal, navigate to the folder.
4. Run: "sh install_snipper.sh"
5. The terminal will ask for your password so it can make the desktop app.
6. Once it's done moving the files to the proper place, you can delete the zip folder and the unzipped folder.
7. Search "Snipper" in the launcher.
8. You now have a snipping tool for Linux.
